# ABtest
A/B test on new website design

## Intro
<p> This repository contains the data regarding an experiment that a company ran to decide if they should implement a new web design interface or keep the old one. Using statistical analysis and analyzing many possible factors the data shows that the old web design yeilds slightly better results than the new design.

## Directions

<p>Load in the .csv files to your local directory to perform analysis on the data. To see what steps I took, view the ABtest HTML or ipynb file. </p>


## Key Points
    * This data does not tell us who has already visited the page, thus previous exposure bias could be playing a role in the results
    * No information about the user is given in data (age, sex, etc.)
